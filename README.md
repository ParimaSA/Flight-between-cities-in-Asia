# Quality of Life by country

 
<br>

### Description

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three parts of my project. The first section contains data on quality of life, which is presented in three formats: 
table data, data for each country, and descriptive data. You can get information on each country's quality of life index, 
along with other variables considered while calculating it, by looking at table data and data by country. In the second part is data storytelling, 
I provide my analysis from the data regarding how the country's standard of education affects people's quality of life. In the third section, 
you can create your own graph by selecting the graph type and other necessary attributes.
